Part 1:
I want you to write a memoized Fibonacci program.

By memoized I mean that no result should be calculated twice,
previous computations get reused instead.

Requirement: make this as simple as possible. Be creative,
use Ruby in unexpected ways, suprise me!

Part 2:
Write a Fibonacci class that can be called like this: Fib.f_x (where x will
be replaced by an actual number).
